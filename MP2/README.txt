I used Visual Studio 2010 to work on this project.  Included in the zip file is this readme, a video showing the running program, the .cpp file, and the .exe file.

To move the "airplane", use the arrow keys.  When a key is triggered as being pressed, the plane will constantly roll/pitch until glut recognises the key is released, or until the opposite key is pressed.  (i.e. hold left, then hold right at the same time will start rolling the plane right)

keys to use:  
	Up arrow - pitches the plane up
	Down arrow - pitches the plane down
	right arrow - rolls the plane right
	left arrow - rolls the plane left
